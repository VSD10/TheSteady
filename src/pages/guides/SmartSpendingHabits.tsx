      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Smart spending isn’t about restricting your lifestyle—it’s about making thoughtful choices that multiply value and joy from every rupee. This guide offers frameworks and hacks for mindful, efficient, and satisfying everyday spending.
      </p>

      <h2>Step 1: Separate Needs from Wants</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Before every purchase, ask: “Is this essential or a nice-to-have?”</li>
        <li>Prioritize spending on essentials; plan treats consciously, not impulsively.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Step 2: Use the “Wait-and-Weigh” Trick</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>When tempted by a non-urgent expense, wait 24–48 hours before buying.</li>
        <li>This simple delay curbs impulse purchases and boosts conscious decision-making.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Step 3: Budget, But Make Room for Fun</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Include small “joy” spends in your monthly budget (coffee, movies, apps).</li>
        <li>Stick to your total budget, but allow flexibility for tiny pleasures that keep you motivated.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Step 4: Hunt for Value and Deals</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Compare prices online before buying anything—use Flipkart, Amazon, Myntra, or price-comparison apps.</li>
        <li>Leverage cashback, reward points, and seasonal sale offers.</li>
        <li>Never feel rushed—good deals come back again!</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Step 5: Apply Mindful Spending Frameworks</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>“Cost per Use” Test:</strong> Consider how often and how long you’ll use the item. Expensive shoes used daily may actually be more “valuable” than a rarely-used gadget.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>“Value over Price” Mindset:</strong> Invest in quality that lasts rather than buying cheap but frequent replacements.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Challenge Yourself:</strong> Try “No-Spend Weeks” or “Minimalist Months”—buy nothing except true essentials for a short period and track the impact!
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Step 6: Real-Life Example Hacks</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Bought a new phone? Sell or recycle the old one for extra money and space.</li>
        <li>Group outings: Use split-payment apps (Google Pay, Splitwise) for fair and transparent group spending.</li>
        <li>Keep festival/family expenses separate from monthly bills using envelopes or accounts.</li>
      </ul>
