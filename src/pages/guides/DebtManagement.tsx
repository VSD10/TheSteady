      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Debt can feel overwhelming, but with the right strategy, you can regain control and work towards a debt-free future. This guide outlines practical steps to help you understand, prioritize, and systematically pay down your debts.
      </p>

      <h2>Step 1: Know Your Debt</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>List all debts:</strong> Note down outstanding loans, credit cards, BNPL, informal borrowings, etc.</li>
        <li><strong>Capture key details:</strong> For each debt, record the total balance, interest rate, minimum payment, and due date.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Step 2: Assess Your Situation</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Calculate your total monthly income and expenses—use your budget as a reference.</li>
        <li>Identify how much you can consistently allocate to debt repayment above minimum monthly payments.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Step 3: Prioritize Your Debts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Two effective repayment strategies:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Debt Avalanche:</strong> Pay off debts with the highest interest rate first—saves most money.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Debt Snowball:</strong> Pay off the smallest balance first—builds motivation and momentum.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Step 4: Build Your Repayment Plan</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Make minimum payments on all debts to avoid penalties.</li>
        <li>Put all extra repayment funds towards your avalanche/snowball target debt.</li>
        <li>Once a debt is paid off, roll its payment amount to the next debt in your list.</li>
      </ol>
      <div style={{
        background: '#FFF7E0',
        borderLeft: '6px solid #FBBD23',
        padding: '16px',
        margin: '16px 0',
      }}>
        <strong>Tip:</strong> Automate payments to never miss a due date and avoid late fees!
      </div>

      <h2>Step 5: Negotiate with Lenders</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Contact your lenders and ask for lower interest rates, waivers on penalties, or modified repayment terms.</li>
        <li>Be honest about hardships—many banks offer restructuring options or settlement plans for genuine cases.</li>
        <li>Get all agreements in writing before accepting new terms.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Actionable Debt Reduction Techniques</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Stop taking on new debt—pause credit card usage and avoid unnecessary purchases.</li>
        <li>Consider debt consolidation: Merge multiple loans into a single EMI with a lower interest rate.</li>
        <li>Increase payments using windfalls (bonuses, gifts) or by earning additional income (side gigs, freelancing).</li>
        <li>Sell unused assets or items to free up cash for debt payoff.</li>
      </ul>

          <strong>Negotiation Script:</strong>
          <pre>
            {"Dear [Lender],\nI’m currently facing financial hardship and finding it difficult to make regular payments. I’d like to discuss options for reducing my interest rate or restructuring my repayment plan. Please let me know what can be done. Thank you."}

      </ul>

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Can I pay off debt with savings?</strong> <br /> Keep an emergency fund, but use extra savings to rapidly reduce high-interest debt.</li>
        <li><strong>What if I can’t make minimum payments?</strong> <br /> Contact lenders immediately to avoid lasting credit score damage—ask about deferment or restructuring.</li>
        <li><strong>Does debt consolidation hurt my credit score?</strong> <br /> Initially, your score may dip, but responsible repayments boost it in the long term.</li>
      </ul>
