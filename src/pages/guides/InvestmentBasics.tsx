        Investing is the process of putting your money into assets that you believe will grow in value over time.
        Even small amounts can compound into significant wealth if managed wisely.
      </p>

      <h3>Understanding Risk</h3>
      <p>
        Every investment comes with risk. Higher potential returns usually mean higher risk.
        Beginners should aim to balance risk and reward based on personal goals, time horizon, and comfort level.
      </p>

      <h3>Key Asset Classes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Stocks:</strong> Ownership in companies with growth potential, but market volatility.</li>
        <li><strong>Bonds:</strong> Lower risk, fixed-income investments, ideal for stability.</li>
        <li><strong>Mutual Funds / ETFs:</strong> Diversified baskets of assets, great for beginners.</li>
        <li><strong>Real Estate:</strong> Tangible asset with growth and rental income potential.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Simple Starter Strategies</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Begin with index funds or ETFs for low-cost diversification.</li>
        <li>Invest a fixed amount regularly (Dollar-Cost Averaging).</li>
        <li>Reinvest dividends and stay invested for the long term.</li>
        <li>Review performance annually and adjust based on life changes.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Start small, be consistent, and let time and compounding work for you.
        Knowledge and patience are your best tools on the investment journey.
