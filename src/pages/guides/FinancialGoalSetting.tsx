      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Setting clear financial goals is the first step toward building wealth, security, and freedom. This guide walks you through practical frameworks and tools for defining, tracking, and achieving goals that suit your unique life and ambitions.
      </p>

      <h2>Step 1: Define Your Why</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Write down why you want to achieve financial goals. Examples: “repay loans,” “travel overseas,” “retire early,” “start my own business.”</li>
        <li>Connect your goals to your personal values—this fuels long-term motivation!</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Step 2: Use the SMART Framework</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>SMART Goals are:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Specific</strong> — Clear and precise (e.g., “Save ₹1,20,000 for laptop purchase”)</li>
            <li><strong>Measurable</strong> — Track progress with numbers and deadlines</li>
            <li><strong>Achievable</strong> — Challenging but realistic for your income and circumstances</li>
            <li><strong>Relevant</strong> — Aligned with your current needs and priorities</li>
            <li><strong>Time-bound</strong> — Has a deadline (e.g., "by October 2026")</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Worksheet Example:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Goal: Save ₹1,20,000</li>
            <li>Why: Upgrade my laptop for freelance work</li>
            <li>Amount per month: ₹10,000</li>
            <li>Timeline: 12 months</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Step 3: Break Down Big Goals</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Separate goals into short-term (months), medium-term (1–3 years), and long-term (5+ years).</li>
        <li>For each, break into actionable mini-steps. Example: “Save for a car” → Know exact price, research financing, set monthly saving targets.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Step 4: Build Success Habits</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Automate monthly transfers to savings accounts or goal-specific funds.</li>
        <li>Set reminders for progress reviews (try monthly or quarterly).</li>
        <li>Celebrate milestones—small wins keep you moving to big ones!</li>
        <li>Visualize your goal—use vision boards or digital trackers.</li>
      </ul>
      <div style={{
        background: '#FFF4E2',
        borderLeft: '6px solid #FF9800',
        padding: '16px',
        margin: '16px 0',
      }}>
        <strong>Tip:</strong> Share your goals with a supportive family member, friend, or accountability group for extra motivation!
      </div>

      <h2>Step 5: Track and Adjust</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Use worksheets, apps, or spreadsheets to monitor progress—update monthly.</li>
        <li>If you fall behind, review and revise targets (don’t give up—adapt!).</li>
        <li>Revisit your “why” regularly to stay inspired.</li>
      </ul>
